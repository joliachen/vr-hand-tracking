## ðŸŽ® How to Launch the App on Quest

On your Quest headset:
1. Go to **Apps**
2. Filter by **Unknown Sources**
3. Find and launch your app

## ðŸ§ª Troubleshooting

- If build fails, make sure:
  - Android modules are installed in Unity Hub
  - Developer Mode is enabled on Quest
  - USB debugging is allowed (check headset prompt)
- Use `adb devices` to verify connection
- Use `adb install -r your_app.apk` for manual install

## âœ… Notes

- APK files cannot be opened directly in Unity.
- Always use the Unity source project (`Assets/`, `ProjectSettings/`, etc.) to make edits and rebuild.
